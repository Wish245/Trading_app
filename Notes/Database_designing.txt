Lets walk through all the data we need to gather from each and every react page in our frontend, with that first identify what tables do we need. 

**SignUp**
username
email
phone
national_id
password

**Login**
username
password

**Home**

**Market**

**OrderPage**
flower name
flower description
flower price (should be per unit)
quantity
total (flower price * quantity)

**PaymentPage**
flower name
quantity
total

**Profile**

Now lets consider the basic tables we need for this. first we need a table for handelling users. 
for now for handelling users we have a table. but for future updates we need following users table.

users
user_id
username
password
email
phone 
national_id
role //whether admin or regular user_id
vendor

So it seems we need to change only a little bit of exsisting user table

then we need to keep track of the stocks basically it should be the flowers
no we can keep it that we keep flowers seperately, but we give users to keep stocks of them seperately. 
so it needs two tables

Flowers
flower_id
flower_name
flower_img_path

Stock
stall_id
stock_id
flower_id
price
quantity
created_date
sample_img_path

so we seperate things like this
first under the flowers section. there are by default flower categories.
they are always categorized based on the flower category.

oh a new idea. we can let users create a stall, within the stall they can create stocks.
so above is not valid anymore except for the flower, its must

stall
stall_id
stall_name
user_id

so first the user sign up 
then user login
then redirects to the home
within home it shows everything as it is right now
new stocks, and categories section
also he/she can go to the profile section
there is the button called create stall
when he clicks it it asks for a name for the stall.
Special Note:
whenever a user creates a stall, user table should be identified him as a vendor. so after that it should show different navigation bar to the user with stall dashboard.
then within the stall, user could see the stocks he has. already created under the categories of flowers. there should be new flower stock button. also there should be a option for registering new flower category. 
but it should be sent to the admin. then admin should approve it and add it to the categories. unless, only predefined categories should be there. there should be a registering flower category option.
then the stock form should ask for the data the table needed as well as a sample photograph. then the stock would be created and under the stalls flowers would be shown in the market space.

now for a regular user the ordering process.

Order
user_id
order_id
stock_id
amount

customer can first send an order request. when a order request is sent they only sent the amount. then it checks from the database if the amount they ask could give from the stock. if yes, customer will redirects to the payment.
if not it should check from the stall for the given flower id, if there any capability of giving the amount asked. if yes, the prices are changed, user should inform about it.
if he/she wish to proceed. if not , order could be cancelled. if yes, same applies. then the payment.

Payement
order_id
payment_id
payment_amount

then need to look for a payment reciept or something. but for now, this is perfect. see you around kid!!!!!!
